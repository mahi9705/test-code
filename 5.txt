There are two methods two save images from website.
1. Image Cyborg
Image Cyborg is a web app that quickly downloads all the images of a web page. 
This Handy tool has a simple and straightforward home interface just like a searching engine.
We have now here to go except download the images.
It comes with some apparent defects.
Here are my using experiences.
  1. Images are mostly low resolution and small sized. Yes, most of them are thumbnail images.
  2. The zip files share the same name: [image-cyborg]. Need to rename the file one by one.
  3. Some logos or avatars images will be packed but you might need them.
2. extract.pics
extract.pics is another geeky tool with a simple and clear interface.
The best part is that we have the chance to preview all the images before downloading and selecting or deselect.
However, we might bump into this error when we try to download all images with one click.
we can write codes to achieve basically everything.
Next, we'll learn the basic steps to use Python web scraping to download images. 
First, we need to install Beautiful Soup by typing pip install bs4 command line.
And type pip install requests to install requests.
After that, follow the steps here:
Import module > 
Make requests instance and pass into URL > 
Pass the requests into a Beautifulsoup() function >
Use 'img' tag to find them all tag ('src').
